### About Me
My name is Alexander I am 27 years old I am a beginner frontend developer. In the fall of 2021 I got interested in programming and immediately began to learn React from courses on YouTube, but my knowledge of JavaScript left much to be desired and that has slowed me down a lot.  Then in the mid-summer of 2022 I learned about the existence of Rs School courses from an interview with one developer on YouTube, unfortunately it was in the middle of summer, and the preparatory courses were running from the beginning of summer. But I joined the course anyway and finished the course in 1532th place out of 11254 enrolled. It was an interesting experience and I decided to continue, at the moment I passed the first stage and I hope I will be able to go to the end and get the necessary skills to get a job as a JavaScript frontend developer.
