### About Me:
My name is Alexander I am 27 years old I am a beginner frontend developer. In the fall of 2021 I got interested in programming and immediately began to learn React from courses on YouTube, but my knowledge of JavaScript left much to be desired and that has slowed me down a lot.  Then in the mid-summer of 2022 I learned about the existence of Rs School courses from an interview with one developer on YouTube, unfortunately it was in the middle of summer, and the preparatory courses were running from the beginning of summer. But I joined the course anyway and finished the course in 1532th place out of 11254 enrolled. It was an interesting experience and I decided to continue, at the moment I passed the first stage and I hope I will be able to go to the end and get the necessary skills to get a job as a JavaScript frontend developer.

### Code example:
**Who likes it? KATA from CODEWARS**: You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.

Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:
```
[]                                -->  "no one likes this"
["Peter"]                         -->  "Peter likes this"
["Jacob", "Alex"]                 -->  "Jacob and Alex like this"
["Max", "John", "Mark"]           -->  "Max, John and Mark like this"
["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"]  -->  "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"
Note: For 4 or more names, the number in "and 2 others" simply increases.
```
My solution:
```
function likes(names) {
  if(names.length === 0)
    return 'no one likes this';
  else if(names.length === 1)
    return `${names[0]} likes this`;
  else if(names.length === 2)
    return `${names[0]} and ${names[1]} like this`;
  else if(names.length === 3)
    return `${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${names[2]} like this`;
  else
    return `${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${names.length - 2} others like this`;
}
```
